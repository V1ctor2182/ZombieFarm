# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms, abbreviations, and acronyms used in the Zombie Farm project and documentation. It includes game-specific terminology as well as technical and development terms.

## Game Terminology

- **Auto-Battler:** A style of combat gameplay where battles play out automatically once initiated. The player’s role is to prepare and position units (zombies), but during the battle the units fight on their own (the Zombie Farm combat system is a 2D side-scrolling auto-battler).
- **Crypt:** A storage building on the farm where extra zombies are kept in stasis. Zombies in the Crypt are not active on the farm (they don’t roam, don’t decay, and don’t defend). The Crypt essentially extends your zombie capacity by housing overflow zombies beyond the active limit.
- **Dark Coins:** The primary in-game currency of Zombie Farm. Dark Coins (often depicted with a skull coin icon) are earned through gameplay (especially by raiding human settlements) and spent on things like buying seeds, building structures, or expanding the farm. They are the undead equivalent of gold coins in other games.
- **Decay:** The gradual deterioration of an undead creature over time. In-game, decay is a mechanic whereby zombies lose a portion of their strength or max health each day if not cared for (fed). Decay can be mitigated or reset by proper maintenance (feeding, etc.). It ensures players must regularly tend to their zombies.
- **Happiness:** A measure of a zombie’s mood and well-being on the farm. Happiness is increased by positive interactions (feeding, petting, comfortable environment) and decreases if the zombie is neglected or unhappy (hungry, lonely, injured). A high happiness can improve a zombie’s performance (they fight better and might produce bonus resources), while very low happiness can lead to reduced efficiency or disobedience.
- **Hit Points (HP):** The health of a unit. Damage reduces hit points; if HP falls to zero, the unit (zombie or enemy) is destroyed or dies. Zombies have HP that can regenerate slowly over time when back on the farm (or be healed with items), whereas enemies do not persist after battle.
- **Necromancer:** The player character, who is a necromancer running the zombie farm. The Necromancer tills plots, grows zombies, and commands them in battle. In combat context, the Necromancer is usually not physically present (except possibly to cast spells); in farm context, this is the character you control to move around and interact.
- **Mutation:** A special transformation or trait that a zombie can develop. Mutations can occur during zombie growth or as a result of exposure to reagents. They grant new abilities or changes in appearance (e.g., a mutation might give a zombie toxic spit or extra limbs with higher damage). Mutations in Zombie Farm are somewhat random but can be influenced by game events or items.
- **Permadeath:** Permanent death. In Zombie Farm, this refers to the fact that if a zombie is killed (HP reaches zero) in combat, it is lost forever. The player cannot resurrect or recover that zombie (unless a specific late-game ability circumvents it). This adds high stakes to combat, as opposed to farm life where zombies don’t die from decay alone.
- **Plant (a Zombie):** To sow a zombie seed in a farm plot. “Planting” in Zombie Farm initiates the growth of a zombie (analogous to planting a crop in farming games, but here the crop is undead). A planted zombie goes through growth stages until it can be harvested.
- **Plot (Grave Plot):** A piece of land on the farm dedicated to growing a zombie. Plots are the equivalent of soil plots in a normal farm, but here they are often depicted as graves or patches of cursed earth. You build plots to increase how many zombies you can grow at once.
- **Raid:** In general gaming terms, a raid is an attack on an enemy stronghold. In Zombie Farm, **raids** usually refer to attacks on human settlements by your zombies (offensive raids), or potentially attacks on your farm by enemies (defensive raids). Base Defense & Raids are part of the design; the player must prepare the farm to withstand raids and sends out zombies to raid human bases.
- **Resource (Farm Resource):** Any collectible material used for building or crafting. Key farm resources include **Rotten Wood** (basic wood material), **Bones** (basic mineral/stone equivalent), **Blood Water** (special water used for watering zombies), **Corpse Dust**, etc. These resources are gathered on the farm or as loot and are spent on constructing plots, buildings, feeding zombies, etc.
- **Soul Essence:** A rare, high-value currency in the game. Soul Essence represents crystallized souls and is used for premium purchases or special upgrades (for example, buying powerful unique seeds or instant growth items). It’s much more scarce than Dark Coins and often obtained from tough boss fights or special events.
- **Sunflower Land (SFL):** The farming game that served as a reference for Zombie Farm’s development. In context, SFL often refers to the game’s token or economy. In Zombie Farm, we have replaced any SFL tokens or blockchain elements with our own in-game economy (Dark Coins, etc.).
- **Zombie:** An undead creature grown on your farm. “Zombie” can refer generally to any undead minion under your control. In Zombie Farm there are many types of zombies (Shamblers, Brutes, etc.), each with different attributes. Zombies are grown from seeds, require maintenance (they can decay), and are the main units for combat.
- **Zombie Seed:** A paranormal seed that can be planted to grow a zombie. Each zombie seed corresponds to a zombie type (e.g., “Shambler Seed” grows a Shambler zombie). This is analogous to crop seeds in other games. Seeds can be obtained via purchase or loot. Planting a seed in a plot starts the zombie lifecycle.
- **Zombie Types:** Specific classes of zombies with unique roles. For example:
  - **Shambler:** A basic, slow zombie (common type; balanced stats).
  - **Runner:** A fast but fragile zombie that can quickly reach and attack backline enemies (archers, etc.).
  - **Brute:** A strong, heavy zombie that soaks up damage (high HP, high attack, very slow).
  - **Spitter:** A ranged zombie that attacks by spitting acid from a distance, dealing toxic damage over time.
  - *(Many other types exist as you progress, e.g., Lich (magic user), Ghoul, etc., each defined in design documents with distinct AI behavior.)*
- **Zombie (Quality) Tiers:** Zombies can have quality levels based on how well they were grown (a concept from design). For instance, a zombie grown with optimal care might be “Bronze” or “Gold” quality, impacting its stats. This concept is borrowed from Sunflower Land’s crop quality mechanics. High quality might mean higher base stats or special traits. (Quality is often indicated by star icons or descriptors like Common, Uncommon, Rare.)

## Development & Technical Terms

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** In development context, refers to the Claude AI sub-agents used to assist coding (architecture agent, test agent, etc.). In gameplay context, refers to the logic controlling non-player characters (e.g., enemy AI behavior in combat). We disambiguate by context – “AI agent” for the former, “enemy AI” or “zombie AI” for the latter.
- **Claude:** The name of the AI model (developed by Anthropic) that serves as our coding assistant. We have multiple Claude instances with specialized roles (Architecture Claude, Test Claude, etc.). When we say “Claude agent,” we mean an AI assistant persona helping with code or documentation.
- **CI:** Stands for **Continuous Integration**, a development practice where code changes are automatically tested and validated whenever they are committed or merged. In our workflow, we intend to use CI to run our test suite on each commit to ensure nothing breaks (though currently the Solo Dev runs tests manually until a CI pipeline is set up).
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Often paired with CI. It means automatically deploying code to production or a playable build whenever it passes CI. For this project, CD is not active yet (since we are in development), but we might use it to push updates to a test server or web page once the game is ready for external testing.
- **DOM:** Document Object Model, the hierarchical structure of elements in a web page. We mention it in context of React Testing Library (interacting with the rendered DOM of our components). Not specific to Zombie Farm, but a web dev term used in testing.
- **DoT:** Stands for **Damage over Time**. A game effect where damage is not all dealt instantly but applied incrementally over a duration (e.g., poison causing a unit to lose HP every second for 10 seconds). We have several DoT effects (poisoned, burning) in combat mechanics.
- **FPS:** Can mean **Frames Per Second** (performance metric for graphics) or **First-Person Shooter** (game genre). In our documentation, if mentioned, it likely refers to frame rate. Maintaining a stable FPS (like 60 FPS) in the game is important for smooth visuals.
- **HUD:** **Heads-Up Display**, the overlay of information in the game UI (health bars, resource counters, etc.) that the player sees during gameplay. We use this term to describe the farm HUD and combat HUD layouts.
- **Jest:** The JavaScript testing framework we use for unit tests. It allows writing tests and assertions to verify our code. We configured Jest for our React/TypeScript project and wrote tests following Jest’s patterns (see META-TESTING for more).
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Zombie Farm’s frontend is built with React (with TypeScript). We create components that React efficiently updates in the browser. It underpins our UI structure, from the farm screens to modals and buttons.
- **React Testing Library (RTL):** A testing utility for React components. It provides tools to render components in a test and simulate user interactions, focusing on testing the UI from the user’s perspective. We use RTL in combination with Jest for our component tests.
- **TDD:** **Test-Driven Development**, a development methodology where tests are written before the code that makes them pass. We follow TDD in this project: first write a failing test that defines desired behavior, then implement code to pass it, then refactor if needed. This helps ensure we only write necessary code and that it’s thoroughly tested.
- **TTL:** In a gameplay context, could mean **Time to Live** (how long an effect lasts) or in networking (irrelevant here). We don’t specifically use TTL in our docs, but mention in case it appears as jargon.
- **TypeScript:** The programming language we use (a superset of JavaScript with static typing). It helps catch errors at compile time and provides better documentation of data shapes. Terms like interface, type, enum in our docs refer to TypeScript constructs.
- **XState:** A library for state machines in JavaScript/TypeScript. We use XState to model our game’s state logic (for example, the global game state machine that handles different game phases). Key terms: **State Machine** (an abstract machine with defined states and transitions), **State Chart** (hierarchical state machine), **Context** (extended state data).
- **XP:** **Experience Points**. Points gained by characters (zombies or the player’s necromancer) to represent progress. Accumulating enough XP typically results in a level up, which improves stats or unlocks abilities. We mention XP when discussing that zombies might gain experience from battles to become stronger over time.
- **Yield:** In farming sim context, yield is the output from a harvest. In Zombie Farm, yield can mean the resources or benefits gained from harvesting a zombie or raiding a location (for example, a harvest might yield a zombie plus some bones; a raid yields Dark Coins and items). We use “yield” in documentation to describe outputs of actions.

This glossary should clarify the terminology used throughout the design and technical docs. It ensures that both developers and designers (and our AI sub-agents) share a common understanding of the terms, reducing ambiguity during implementation.
